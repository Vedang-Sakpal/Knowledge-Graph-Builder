# Crude Oil Production Unit (COPU) Process Description

## Overview

The crude oil production unit is designed to process, separate, and condition crude oil from field production, separating associated gas and produced water, and preparing the oil for storage and export. The unit has a nominal capacity of 10 Mbpd (million barrels per day) and handles crude oil with an API gravity of 33°.

## Main Process Sections

### 1. **Incoming Crude Oil and Initial Separation**

- **Field Production Feed:**  
  - Crude oil from wells arrives at the plant as a mixture of oil, gas, and water.
- **Free Water Knock-Out Drum (FWKO):**  
  - The first separation stage, FWKO is a three-phase separator vessel.
  - It removes the bulk of free water from the crude oil stream.
  - The oily outlet stream from FWKO typically contains up to 15% BS&W (Basic Sediment and Water).
  - Separated water is sent to water treatment facilities.
  - Separated gas is routed for use as fuel gas or flared in a burn pit[1].

### 2. **Heater–Treater Separation**

- **Heater–Treater:**  
  - The oily stream from FWKO enters the Heater–Treater, which combines a three-phase separator with a heating system.
  - The stream is heated using a fuel gas firetube to reach a temperature of 150–170°F.
  - This heating aids in further separation of oil and emulsified water.
  - The Heater–Treater reduces BS&W in the oil stream to about 0.5%[1].

### 3. **Electrostatic Desalter Conditioning**

- **Electrostatic Desalter:**  
  - The oil stream from the Heater–Treater is sent to the Electrostatic Desalter for final water and salt removal.
  - An electric field is applied to promote coalescence of small water droplets, enhancing separation.
  - Fresh well water is injected before the desalter to achieve the required dilution for salt removal.
  - The desalter outlet oil stream contains less than 0.2% BS&W and less than 15 PTB (pounds per thousand barrels) of salt.
  - Water separated in the desalter is recycled to the Heater–Treater to minimize fresh water consumption[1].

### 4. **Oil Storage and Export**

- **Conditioned Oil:**  
  - After dehydration and desalting, the oil is conditioned for Reid Vapor Pressure (RVP).
  - The treated oil is stored in tanks before being pumped to the custody transfer point for export[1].

### 5. **Produced Water Treatment**

- **Water Treatment:**  
  - Separated water from FWKO, Heater–Treater, and desalter purges enters the water treatment system.
  - The first stage is a Skimmer–Tank, where gravity separation removes most free and emulsified oil.
  - The treated water is pumped and re-injected into a disposal well[1].

## Key Process Equipment

- **Three-Phase Separators (FWKO, Heater–Treater):**  
  - Separate oil, gas, and water.
- **Electrostatic Desalter:**  
  - Removes residual water and salts.
- **Heating System (Heater–Treater):**  
  - Provides thermal energy for emulsion breaking.
- **Water Treatment System (Skimmer–Tank):**  
  - Further treats produced water before reinjection.
- **Storage Tanks:**  
  - Store treated crude oil before export.
