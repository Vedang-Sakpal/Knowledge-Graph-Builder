# High-Level Radioactive Liquid Waste (HLLW) Storage Tank System – Process Description

## Overview

The high-level radioactive liquid waste (HLLW) storage tank system is designed for the interim storage of highly radioactive, corrosive, and heat-generating liquid waste produced from nuclear fuel reprocessing. The system uses double-shell stainless-steel tanks installed in underground reinforced concrete vaults to ensure containment and facilitate long-term storage prior to waste solidification.

## Main Components

- **Double-Shell Storage Tank Structure**
  - **Primary Tank:** Free-standing, vertical, cylindrical stainless-steel vessel that directly contains the HLLW.
  - **Secondary Tank:** Stainless-steel liner surrounding the primary tank, creating an annular space to capture any leaks.
  - **Concrete Vault:** Reinforced concrete structure encasing the secondary tank, providing structural support and shielding.
  - **Annular Space:** Equipped with sumps and level detection for leak monitoring and maintenance access.

- **Agitation System**
  - Maintains solids in suspension and prevents crystallization or sludge buildup.
  - Uses a combination of jet-ballast agitation (compressed air jets) and air-lift recirculation units for thorough mixing.

- **Cooling-Water System**
  - Removes decay heat from the waste to maintain tank temperature around 55–60°C.
  - Consists of internal cooling coils with a two-circuit design: primary circuit (demineralized water in coils) and secondary circuit (external heat exchanger).
  - Standby cooling coils are included for redundancy.

- **Ventilation System**
  - Actively ventilates both the primary tank and the annular space.
  - Maintains slight negative pressure to prevent vapor release and manages removal of hydrogen and other radiolytic gases.
  - Includes HEPA filters on both inlet and outlet streams to control particulate release.

- **Instrumentation and Monitoring**
  - Multiple, redundant sensors for continuous measurement of liquid level, temperature, acidity, vapor space pressure, and hydrogen concentration.
  - Alarms and data logging for all critical parameters.
  - Sampling systems for liquid and gas at various points in the tank.

- **Transfer and Spare Capacity**
  - Transfer systems allow for movement of waste between tanks in case of maintenance or leak detection.
  - Spare tanks are maintained to provide emergency storage capacity.

## Process Flow

1. **Waste Receipt and Storage**
   - HLLW, typically as an aqueous nitric acid solution containing fission products and actinides, is transferred into the primary tank.
   - The tank is filled and monitored to ensure the liquid level remains within design limits.

2. **Agitation and Homogenization**
   - Agitation systems are periodically operated to keep solids suspended and ensure uniform composition throughout the tank.
   - Air agitation also helps dilute and remove hydrogen gas generated by radiolysis.

3. **Heat Removal**
   - Decay heat from radioactive material is continuously removed by circulating demineralized water through internal coils.
   - The temperature of the waste and cooling water is monitored and controlled to prevent overheating and evaporation.

4. **Ventilation and Gas Management**
   - The tank’s vapor space is continuously ventilated to remove hydrogen and other gases.
   - Off-gas passes through condensers, scrubbers, and HEPA filters before monitored release to the environment.
   - The annular space is also ventilated to manage temperature and potential leaks.

5. **Parameter Monitoring and Control**
   - Instrumentation provides real-time data on level, temperature, acidity, pressure, and hydrogen concentration.
   - Operators use this data to maintain optimal storage conditions and respond to deviations as needed.

6. **Sampling and Inspection**
   - Liquid and gas samples are periodically taken for analysis.
   - Remote inspection devices are used for visual and ultrasonic examination of tank integrity.

7. **Waste Transfer and Maintenance**
   - If required, waste can be transferred to a spare tank for maintenance or in the event of a detected leak.
   - All internal equipment (coils, agitators, sensors) is accessible from the tank top for servicing.
