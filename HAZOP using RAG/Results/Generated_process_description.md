## 1. Main Material Streams

The plant handles two primary fluid streams: hot water and exhaust gas.

**1.1 Hot Water Recirculation and Heating Loop**
This loop is responsible for heating circulating water using waste heat and returning it to the Hot Water Tank (T-200).

*   **Source: Hot Water Tank (T-200)**
    *   The "Hot Water Tank" (T-200) serves as the central reservoir for hot water. It receives "Make up Water" (source: TS78-P-PID-011) and "Circulating Water" returning from the "CNG Heat Exchanger (E-200)" (source: TS78-P-PID-005_2). It also receives condensate from the Vapour Condensor (E-500).
*   **Pumping Stage (P-500A/B)**
    *   Hot water is drawn from the "Hot Water Tank" (T-200) through an 8-inch line. This line splits into two parallel branches, each with a "Water Circulation Pump (Centrifugal Pump)" (P-500A and P-500B, respectively). Each pump is preceded by a Butterfly valve (size: 8"), a Y-type strainer, and a Reducer (8"x4") at its suction, and followed by a Reducer (4"x5"), a Check valve (size: 5"), and another Butterfly valve (size: 5") at its discharge. These pumps circulate water from the tank, increasing its pressure to 2.5 barg.
*   **Waste Heat Recovery Unit (E-300)**
    *   The discharge lines from P-500A and P-500B combine. The combined stream flows through a Butterfly valve, a Mounting Flange (with Temperature Transmitter TT-0702), and then enters the coil side of the "Waste Heat Recovery Unit" (E-300). In E-300, the water is heated from 63 to 90 degree C by transferring heat from hot exhaust gas.
*   **Return to Hot Water Tank (T-200)**
    *   Heated water exits the "Waste Heat Recovery Unit" (E-300). This line includes a Gate valve, a Junction with a Vent valve and a Pressure Safety Valve (PSV-0701), and then several Mounting Flanges equipped with instruments (Flow Transmitter FT-0701, Temperature Indicator TI-0704, Temperature Transmitter TT-0703). Finally, the water flows through a Butterfly valve (size: 5"), a Curved Vent Pipe, and back into the "Hot Water Tank" (T-200) at N8.

**1.2 Exhaust Gas Heating Stream**
This stream supplies the waste heat to the circulating water.

*   **Source: Compressors (K-101/../110)**
    *   "Exhaust Gas" (source: From Compressor K-101/../110) enters the system.
*   **Temperature Control and Flow to WHRU**
    *   The exhaust gas passes through a Test Point (TP-027/../036), a "Temperature Control Valve" (TCV-0701A/../K), and a Multiple Joint. It then goes through a Mounting point (with Temperature Transmitter TT-0705) before entering the shell side of the "Waste Heat Recovery Unit" (E-300).
*   **Discharge: "To Safe Area"**
    *   After transferring its heat, the cooled exhaust gas exits the "Waste Heat Recovery Unit" (E-300) and flows to the "To Safe Area" (sink).

**1.3 Hot Water Product Stream**
This stream delivers hot water for an external process.

*   **Source: Hot Water Tank (T-200)**
    *   Hot water is drawn from the "Hot Water Tank" (T-200) through another 8-inch line. This line splits into two parallel branches, each with a "Hot Water Pump (Centrifugal Pump)" (P-300A and P-300B, respectively). Each pump is preceded by a Gate valve (size: 8"), a Y-type strainer, and a Reducer (8"x5"), and followed by a Reducer (4"x6"), a Check valve (size: 6"), and a Gate valve (size: 6") at its discharge. These pumps increase the water pressure to 3.35 barg.
*   **Discharge: "To CNG Heat Exchanger (E-200)"**
    *   The discharge lines from P-300A and P-300B combine. The combined stream then exits the plant to the "To CNG Heat Exchanger (E-200)" (sink: TS78-P-PID-005_2).

**1.4 Ancillary Streams**

*   **Hot Water Tank Vent & Condensate:** Vapor from the "Hot Water Tank" (T-200) vents through the "Vapour Condensor" (E-500). Condensate from E-500 returns to the tank. Non-condensibles from E-500 exit via a Curved Vent Pipe.
*   **Tank Drain:** The "Hot Water Tank" (T-200) has a drain line with a "Drain valve" (size: 3") leading "To drain".
*   **Recirculation Line Drain:** A drain line from the recirculation loop after the P-500 pumps, through a Gate valve (drain valve, size: 3/4"), leads "To Drain".
*   **WHRU Safety Vent:** The Pressure Safety Valve (PSV-0701) on the WHRU outlet line vents to "To vent" in case of overpressure.
*   **High Level Overflow:** A signal from the Level Switch High Low (LSHL-0701) on T-200 is directed "To P-600", indicating a mechanism for high-level discharge or diversion.

## 2. Key Equipment and Purpose

Here's a breakdown of the major equipment and their roles:

*   **Hot Water Tank (T-200)**
    *   **Type:** Storage tank
    *   **Capacity:** 290 m3 (design), 250 m3 (operating)
    *   **Purpose:** Acts as a buffer and storage vessel for the hot water. It collects makeup water, circulating water from external heat exchangers, and the heated water from the waste heat recovery unit. It also serves as the suction source for the hot water circulation pumps (P-500A/B) and the hot water delivery pumps (P-300A/B).
*   **E-500 (Vapour Condensor)**
    *   **Type:** Vapour Condensor
    *   **Design Parameters:** 2 barg design pressure, 120 degree C design temperature, 127 kW heat duty, 0.056 kg/s tube capacity.
    *   **Purpose:** Condenses steam/vapor from the "Hot Water Tank" (T-200) vent, returning the valuable condensate to the tank and preventing excessive water loss while venting non-condensible gases.
*   **P-500A & P-500B (Water Circulation Pumps)**
    *   **Type:** Centrifugal Pumps (Water Circulation Pumps)
    *   **Capacity:** 48 m3/hr each
    *   **Discharge Pressure:** 2.5 barg each
    *   **Purpose:** These are redundant pumps (A/B configuration) responsible for circulating water from the "Hot Water Tank" (T-200) through the "Waste Heat Recovery Unit" (E-300) to be heated, and then back to the tank. They provide the necessary pressure to overcome system losses in the heating loop. Each is driven by an 11 kW "Motor".

    *   **Purpose:** The core of the heating system. It recovers waste heat from high-temperature "Exhaust Gas" (from Compressors K-101/../110) and transfers it to the circulating water, significantly increasing the water's temperature without direct energy input from fuel.
*   **P-300A & P-300B (Hot Water Pumps)**
    *   **Type:** Centrifugal Pumps (Hot Water Pumps)
    *   **Capacity:** 140 m3/hr each
    *   **Suction Pressure:** Atmospheric pressure (implies that the suction pressure is effectively the hydrostatic head from the tank)
    *   **Discharge Pressure:** 3.35 barg each
    *   **Purpose:** These are also redundant pumps (A/B configuration) designed to deliver hot water from the "Hot Water Tank" (T-200) to the downstream "CNG Heat Exchanger (E-200)". They provide the necessary flow and pressure for the hot water utility. Each is driven by a 25 kW "Motor".
*   **Motors (M)**
    *   **Type:** Electric Motors
    *   **Power:** 11 kW (for P-500A/B), 25 kW (for P-300A/B)
    *   **Purpose:** Provide mechanical power to drive the centrifugal pumps, converting electrical energy into mechanical energy to move the water.

## 3. Control and Energy Flows

The plant incorporates several control loops and energy transfer mechanisms to maintain safe and efficient operation.

**3.1 Hot Water Tank Level Control**

*   **Measurement:** "Level Indicator" (LI-0701) detects the level in the "Hot Water Tank" (T-200).
*   **Alarm/Switch:** "Level Switch High Low" (LSHL-0701) activates when the tank level goes beyond high or low limits (5200 mm HH, 500 mm LL). "Level Switch Low" (LSL-0702) activates specifically when the level goes low.
*   **Action/Alarm:** LSHL-0701 sends a signal "To P-600", indicating that a high level may trigger discharge to P-600. LSL-0702 sends a signal to "Level Alarm Low" (LAL-0702). LAL-0702, in turn, signals the motors for all circulation and hot water pumps (P-500A/B motors, P-300A/B motors), suggesting a low-level interlock or shutdown to protect the pumps from cavitation.

**3.2 Hot Water Tank Temperature Monitoring**

*   **Measurement:** "Temperature Transmitter" (TT-0706) located on the "Hot Water Tank" (T-200) sends a signal.
*   **Alarm/Indication:** "Temperature indicator" (TI-0706) receives this signal, detects temperature, and provides an alarm if the high limit of 95 degree C is exceeded.

**3.3 WHRU Outlet Water Temperature Control**

*   **Measurement:** "Temperature Transmitter" (TT-0703) detects the temperature of the heated water exiting the "Waste Heat Recovery Unit" (E-300).
*   **Control/Alarm:** "Temperature Indicating Controller" (TIC-0703) receives the signal from TT-0703, controls the temperature by manipulating a valve, and alarms if the temperature exceeds 95 degree C.
*   **Final Control Element:** TIC-0703 manipulates the "Butterfly valve" (size: 5", ID: 78) in the return line to the "Hot Water Tank" (T-200). This control loop likely throttles the heated water flow returning to the tank to maintain the desired tank or process water temperature. It is plausible that TIC-0703 also sends a signal to the "Temperature Control Valve" (TCV-0701A/../K) which regulates the "Exhaust Gas" flow rate to the E-300 for precise temperature control.

**3.4 Exhaust Gas Inlet Temperature Monitoring (WHRU)**

*   **Measurement:** "Temperature Transmitter" (TT-0705) measures the temperature of the "Exhaust Gas" entering the "Waste Heat Recovery Unit" (E-300).
*   **Alarm/Indication:** "Temperature Indicating Alarm" (TIA-0705) receives this signal, detects temperature, and provides an alarm.

**3.5 Flow Monitoring (WHRU Outlet Water)**

*   **Measurement:** "Flow Transmitter" (FT-0701) detects the flow rate of the heated water exiting the "Waste Heat Recovery Unit" (E-300).
*   **Indication:** "Flow Indicator" (FI-0701) displays the flow rate.

**3.6 Pump Pressure Monitoring and Protection (P-300A/B)**

*   **Measurement:** "Pressure Transmitter" (PT-0703A/B) detects the discharge pressure of the "Hot Water Pump" (P-300A/B).
*   **Alarm/Indication:** "Pressure Indicator" (PI-0703A/B) receives this signal, displays the pressure, and alarms if the pressure exceeds a high-high limit of 4.5 barg.
*   **Action:** PT-0703A/B also sends a signal to the respective "Motor" (for P-300A/B), likely for motor protection or shutdown based on pressure excursions (e.g., low pressure due to cavitation, high pressure due to blocked discharge).
*   **Local Indication:** "Pressure Indicator" (PI-0702A/B) also displays the discharge pressure for P-300A/B.
    *   Similarly, "Pressure Indicators" (PI-0704A/B) provide discharge pressure readings for P-500A/B. Additional pressure indicators PI-0707 and PI-0708 are present on the suction lines of P-300B and P-500B respectively.

**3.7 Pump Start/Stop and Status Control**

*   **Operation:** Each pump (P-500A/B, P-300A/B) has associated "Hand Switches" (HS-0703A/B, HS-0704A/B for P-500; HS-0701A/B, HS-0702A/B for P-300) for selecting operating mode (Manual, Off, Auto) and initiating Start/Stop actions.
*   **Indication:** "Light/ Indicator" (XL-0703A/B, XL-0704A/B, XL-0701A/B, XL-0702A/B) show the equipment mode and running status.
*   **Alarm:** "Alarm Indicator" (XA-0702A/B, XA-0701A/B) signals fault conditions for the respective pumps.

**3.8 Pressure Safety (WHRU Outlet)**

*   **Safety Device:** "Pressure Safety Valve" (PSV-0701) on the water outlet of the "Waste Heat Recovery Unit" (E-300) is set to activate when pressure goes beyond 10 barg, relieving excess pressure to "To vent" to protect the system.

**3.9 Energy Flow**

*   **Heat Input:** The primary energy input is in the form of waste heat from "Exhaust Gas" (from Compressor K-101/../110) to the "Waste Heat Recovery Unit" (E-300), with a significant heat duty of 1283 kW. This directly heats the circulating water.
*   **Heat Removal/Recovery:** The "Vapour Condensor" (E-500) removes 127 kW of heat from the tank vapor, recovering it as condensate.
*   **Mechanical Energy:** "Motors" provide 11 kW (for P-500A/B) and 25 kW (for P-300A/B) of power to the pumps, adding mechanical energy to the water, primarily increasing its pressure.
