## 1. Main Material Streams

The primary material flow in the sour water stripper plant involves processing an incoming refinery sour water stream to separate hydrocarbons and strip dissolved acid gases before the treated water is sent for further processing.

1.  **Sour Water Feed and Slop Oil Separation:**
    *   The `REFINERY Unit` (src1) supplies `SW from refinery pipe` containing sour water, hydrocarbons (slop oil), ammonia, and hydrogen sulfide.
    *   This stream enters the `Surge Drum-1` (sg). Here, due to density differences, `slop oil` separates as a lighter phase, and sour water settles as a heavier phase.
    *   The separated slop oil is drawn from `Surge Drum-1` via the `oil_rec_pump`, passes through `NRV-3`, and is then routed as `Slop pipe 2` to the `SLOP-OIL-CRUDE-TANK-WWT` (s4) for recovery.
    *   A `vent pipe` from `Surge Drum-1` goes to `TO-FLARE-SYSTEM` (s2) for venting any light gases.
    *   A `drain pipe` with a `Drain Valve` (dv) allows manual draining from `Surge Drum-1` to `DRAIN-TO-SEWER` (s1).

2.  **Sour Water Storage and Pre-treatment:**
    *   The separated sour water from the bottom of `Surge Drum-1` is pumped by the `SW Feed Pump` (sw_feed_pump), through `NRV-4` and `FCV-2` (which regulates flow), to the `SW Storage` (sw) tank.
    *   In the `SW Storage` tank, any `residual carried-over hydrocarbons` are further skimmed off and sent to `TO-SKIM-RECYCLE` (s5).
    *   A `vent pipe 2` from `SW Storage` connects to `PRV-1`, which vents to `TO-ATM` (s3) for overpressure protection.

3.  **Stripper Feed Preheating and Stripping:**
    *   Sour water from the `SW Storage` tank is transferred by the `Stripper feed Pump` (stripper_feed_pump), through `NRV-5`, and then passes through a `Flow sensor 1` (f1) and `FCV-3` (which controls the flow rate).
    *   This regulated sour water stream is then preheated in the `Stripper OVHD Condenser` (stripper_cond), utilizing heat from the hot overhead vapors of the stripper.
    *   The preheated sour water is then fed into the `Sour Water Stripper` (sws) column.
    *   `STEAM-IN` (src2) is introduced into the bottom of the `Sour Water Stripper` via `FCV-5` to strip out dissolved `ammonia (NH₃)` and `hydrogen sulfide (H₂S)`. These gases become volatile and are carried overhead with the steam.
    *   `PRV-2` provides pressure relief for the `Sour Water Stripper`.

4.  **Overhead System and Reflux:**
    *   The hot overhead vapor mixture (steam, H₂S, NH₃) from the `Sour Water Stripper` (sws) flows to the `Stripper OVHD Condenser` (stripper_cond). Here, the steam condenses, and the hot sour water feed provides the necessary cooling, simultaneously preheating the feed.
    *   The condensed liquid and non-condensable gases flow into the `SWS OVHD Accumulator` (sws_acc).
    *   The `non-condensable` acid gases (`H₂S, NH₃`) are separated from the condensate in the accumulator and sent to `ACID-GAS-TO-S-PLANT-EX` (s6) for further sulfur recovery or treatment.
    *   A portion of the condensate (water) from the `SWS OVHD Accumulator` is pumped by the `Reflux Pump` (reflux_pump), through `NRV-6` and `FCV-4` (reflux control valve), and returned as `reflux` to the `Sour Water Stripper` to improve separation efficiency.

5.  **Treated Water Effluent:**
    *   The stripped water (now largely free of dissolved gases and hydrocarbons) accumulates at the bottom of the `Sour Water Stripper` (sws).
    *   This treated water is pumped out by the `Bottoms Pump` (bottoms_pump), passes through `NRV-7` and `FCV-6` (which controls the flow/level), and is then sent to `WATER-TREATMENT` (s7) for final processing or safe disposal.

## 3. Detail the Control and Energy Flows

### Control Loops:

The plant incorporates several critical control loops to ensure stable and efficient operation:

1.  **Surge Drum Low Level Control (Slop Oil Recovery):**
    *   **Sensor:** `Level sensor 1` (l1), a low-level sensor on `Surge Drum-1`.
    *   **Controller:** `LLC` (Low Level Controller).
    *   **Final Control Element:** `Oil Recovery Pump` (oil_rec_pump).
    *   **Operation:** If the liquid level in `Surge Drum-1` falls below a set low point, `l1` sends a signal to `LLC`. `LLC` then controls the `oil_rec_pump` to reduce or stop the pumping of slop oil, preventing the pump from running dry or taking suction from the water phase, and maintaining a minimum level for separation.

2.  **Surge Drum High Level Control (SW Feed to Storage):**
    *   **Sensor:** `Level sensor 2` (l2), a high-level sensor on `Surge Drum-1`.
    *   **Controller:** `HLC` (High Level Controller).
    *   **Final Control Element:** `FCV-2` (Flow Control Valve on the `SW feed pipe` to `SW Storage`).
    *   **Operation:** If the liquid level in `Surge Drum-1` rises above a set high point, `l2` signals `HLC`. `HLC` then modulates `FCV-2` to increase the flow of sour water to `SW Storage`, preventing overfilling of the surge drum. Conversely, if the level drops, `FCV-2` would close to maintain a minimum level.

3.  **Stripper Feed and Steam Flow Ratio Control:**
    *   **Process Variable (SW Feed Flow):** Flow measured by `Flow sensor 1` (f1) on the `SW feed pipe` to the `Stripper OVHD Condenser`.
    *   **Controller 1 (SW Feed Flow):** `FC-1` (Flow Controller).
    *   **Final Control Element 1 (SW Feed):** `FCV-3` (Flow Control Valve on the `SW feed pipe`).
    *   **Controller 2 (Steam Flow):** `FC-2` (Flow Controller for `steam pipe`).
    *   **Final Control Element 2 (Steam):** `FCV-5` (Flow Control Valve on the `steam pipe`).
    *   **Operation:** `f1` measures the sour water feed rate and sends a signal to `FC-1`, which then adjusts `FCV-3` to maintain the desired sour water feed flow rate to the stripper. Crucially, `FC-1` also sends a signal to `FC-2`, indicating a cascade or ratio control setup. This implies that the steam flow rate (`FCV-5`) is adjusted by `FC-2` in proportion to the sour water feed rate, ensuring an optimal steam-to-sour-water ratio for efficient stripping.

4.  **SWS Overhead Accumulator Level Control (Reflux Control):**
    *   **Sensor:** `Level sensor 3` (l3) on the `SWS OVHD Accumulator`.
    *   **Controller:** `LC-1` (Level Controller).
    *   **Final Control Element:** `FCV-4` (Flow Control Valve on the `reflux pipe`).
    *   **Operation:** `l3` monitors the condensate level in the accumulator. `LC-1` receives this signal and adjusts `FCV-4` to control the amount of condensate returned as reflux to the `Sour Water Stripper`. This maintains a stable level in the accumulator and ensures proper reflux to the column.

5.  **Sour Water Stripper Bottoms Level Control (Treated Water Effluent):**
    *   **Sensor:** `Level sensor 4` (l4) on the `Sour Water Stripper`.
    *   **Controller:** `LC-2` (Level Controller).
    *   **Final Control Element:** `FCV-6` (Flow Control Valve on the `treated water effluent pipe`).
    *   **Operation:** `l4` measures the liquid level at the bottom of the `Sour Water Stripper`. `LC-2` uses this information to modulate `FCV-6`, thereby controlling the flow rate of the treated water effluent to `WATER-TREATMENT`. This prevents the stripper from running dry or overfilling with treated water.

*   **Pressure Sensors for Pumps:** Pressure sensors (`p_oil_rec_pump`, `p_sw_feed_pump`, `p_stripper_feed_pump`, `p_reflux_pump`, `p_bottoms_pump`) are connected to their respective pumps. While these are explicitly mentioned as "pressure indicator" sensors, they typically feed into the control system for monitoring pump health, detecting cavitation, or indicating blockages, but are not shown as part of active control loops in this specific P&ID (i.e., they don't directly control a FCE).

### Energy Flows:

*   **Steam Input:** The primary energy input to the process is `STEAM-IN` (src2), which is fed into the `Sour Water Stripper` (sws) via `FCV-5`. This steam provides the heat required to vaporize the dissolved ammonia and hydrogen sulfide from the sour water.
*   **Heat Recovery/Exchange:** The `Stripper OVHD Condenser` (stripper_cond) plays a crucial role in energy efficiency. It recovers heat from the hot overhead vapors (steam, H₂S, NH₃) from the `Sour Water Stripper` by using the cold incoming sour water feed as a cooling medium. This preheats the feed before it enters the stripper, reducing the steam demand for the column, and simultaneously condenses the overheads.

## 4. Summarize Inputs and Outputs

### Main Chemical Inputs to the Process:

1.  **Refinery Sour Water:** From `REFINERY Unit` (src1), containing water, slop oil (hydrocarbons), ammonia (NH₃), and hydrogen sulfide (H₂S).
2.  **Steam:** From `STEAM-IN` (src2), used as the stripping medium.

### Final Products or Waste Streams Leaving the System:

1.  **Recovered Slop Oil:** Sent to `SLOP-OIL-CRUDE-TANK-WWT` (s4) from the `Surge Drum-1`.
2.  **Hydrocarbon Oil Skim:** Sent to `TO-SKIM-RECYCLE` (s5) from the `SW Storage` tank.
3.  **Acid Gases (H₂S, NH₃):** Non-condensables from the `SWS OVHD Accumulator` (sws_acc) sent to `ACID-GAS-TO-S-PLANT-EX` (s6) for further treatment (e.g., sulfur recovery).
4.  **Treated Water Effluent:** Stripped water from the `Sour Water Stripper` (sws) sent to `WATER-TREATMENT` (s7) for final purification or safe disposal.
5.  **Vents and Drains (Minor/Safety Streams):**
    *   `TO-FLARE-SYSTEM` (s2): Vent from `Surge Drum-1`.
    *   `TO-ATM` (s3): Vent from `SW Storage` via `PRV-1`.
    *   `DRAIN-TO-SEWER` (s1): Manual drain from `Surge Drum-1`.
    *   Pressure relief from `Sour Water Stripper` (prv2) (destination not explicitly specified, but typically to flare or a containment system).
