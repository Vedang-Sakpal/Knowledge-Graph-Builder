# Floating Roof Methanol Storage Tank System – Process Description

## Overview

The floating roof storage tank system is designed for the storage and transfer of large volumes of methanol in a petrochemical facility. Each tank is equipped with a floating roof that moves vertically with the liquid level to minimize vapor space and reduce evaporation losses. The system includes instrumentation for monitoring and control, as well as facilities for transferring methanol to ships via pumps and pipelines.

## Main Components

- **Floating Roof Storage Tanks**
  - Each tank has a capacity of 64,700 cubic meters and an inner diameter of 63 meters.
  - The floating roof rests directly on the methanol surface and rises or falls with the liquid level.
  - The roof is supported by deck legs when the tank is nearly empty, creating a vapor space.

- **Instrumentation and Control**
  - Tanks are fitted with level sensors, pressure transmitters, pressure control valves (PCV), breather valves (BV), and associated alarms.
  - Nitrogen blanketing is used to maintain a controlled atmosphere above the methanol and to regulate pressure.
  - Level alarms are set within a normal operating range (2.892–19.280 meters).

- **Methanol Transfer System**
  - Methanol is transferred from storage tanks to a pier for ship loading via three pumps (A, B, and C).
  - Pumps are interlocked to ensure operation only under permitted conditions, preventing overfilling or excessive discharge.
  - Transfer pipelines are equipped with block valves, flow valves, and non-return valves (NRV) to control and direct flow.

## Process Flow

1. **Methanol Storage**
   - Methanol is received and stored in large floating roof tanks at atmospheric pressure.
   - The floating roof adjusts with the liquid level, minimizing vapor space and reducing evaporation.

2. **Pressure and Level Management**
   - Nitrogen is supplied to the vapor space above the floating roof to maintain pressure within set limits.
   - Pressure control valves (PCV) automatically open or close to regulate nitrogen supply.
   - Breather valves (BV) provide additional pressure relief if needed.
   - Level sensors and alarms monitor the methanol level, with high and low alarms triggering operational responses.

3. **Methanol Transfer for Export**
   - When required, methanol is pumped from the storage tanks to the pier for ship loading.
   - The pumps are operated based on interlocks and process conditions to avoid overfilling or running dry.
   - Flow through the export line is managed by flow valves, with minimum flow paths available to protect the pumps from low-flow conditions.

4. **Instrumentation and Monitoring**
   - Continuous monitoring of tank level, pressure, and flow ensures process control and operational efficiency.
   - Instrumentation includes level transmitters, pressure transmitters, and flow transmitters, all integrated into the plant’s control system.
