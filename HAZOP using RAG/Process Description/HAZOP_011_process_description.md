## Overall Process Description and Capacity

The COPU is designed to process **10 million barrels per day (Mbpd)** of **33° API** crude oil. The process separates and treats the three primary components from the field production stream:

* **Crude Oil:** The primary product, which is treated to meet specific quality standards for storage and custody transfer.
* **Associated Gas:** Approximately **10 million standard cubic feet per day (MMscfd)** of gas is separated from the oil. This gas is utilized as fuel gas within the facility, with any excess being sent to a burn pit.
* **Produced Water:** Approximately **10 million barrels of water per day (Mbwpd)** is separated and treated before being re-injected into a disposal well.

The final treated oil is conditioned to meet Reid Vapor Pressure (RVP) requirements, dehydrated, and desalted before being stored in tanks for transfer.

## Detailed Process Flow

The facility consists of two main treatment trains: one for the oil and one for the produced water.

### 1. Oil Treatment Process

The oil treatment process is a three-stage system designed to progressively remove water and salt from the crude oil.

* **Stage 1: Bulk Water Separation**
    * **Equipment:** Free Water Knock-Out Drum (FWKO), designated as **V-001**.
    * **Process:** The raw production stream (oil, gas, water) from the wells first enters the FWKO, which is a three-phase separator. It leverages gravity to perform the initial bulk separation of free water from the oil. The vessel is designed with sufficient liquid holdup time to manage potential slugs from the feed pipelines.
    * **Performance:** The oily stream leaving the FWKO has a Basic Sediment and Water (BS&W) content of **15%**.

* **Stage 2: Emulsion Breaking and Heating**
    * **Equipment:** Heater-Treater separator, designated as **V-002**.
    * **Process:** The oily stream from the FWKO is fed into the Heater-Treater. This unit combines a three-phase separator with an internal heating element (a fuel gas firetube) to heat the emulsion. The heat breaks the emulsion, allowing for more efficient separation of the remaining water.
    * **Operating Temperature:** The ideal operating temperature for this separation is in the range of **150-170°F**.
    * **Performance:** The oily stream leaving the Heater-Treater has a BS&W content of **0.5%**.

* **Stage 3: Desalting and Final Polishing**
    * **Equipment:** Electrostatic-Desalter, designated as **V-003**.
    * **Process:** The oil from the Heater-Treater undergoes final conditioning in the Electrostatic-Desalter. This equipment applies a high-voltage electric field to the fluid, which promotes the coalescence of the smallest water droplets, allowing for their final removal. To remove salt, fresh well water is injected into the oil stream just before it enters the desalter, acting as a dilution medium.
    * **Recycle Loop:** To conserve fresh water, the saline water removed from the Electrostatic-Desalter is recycled back to the inlet of the Heater-Treater. This recycled water further aids in the dilution of salt in the preceding stage.
    * **Performance:** The final treated oil leaving this unit has a BS&W content of **0.2%** and a salt content below **15 pounds per thousand barrels (PTB)**.

### 2. Water Treatment Process

The water treatment system is designed to remove residual oil from the produced water before disposal.

* **Equipment:** Skimmer-Tank.
* **Process:** Water streams from the FWKO, Heater-Treater, and sporadic purges from the Electrostatic-Desalter are collected and sent to the Skimmer-Tank. This vessel uses gravity separation with a long retention time and slow velocity profiles to allow emulsified oil to separate from the water.
* **Performance:** The outlet water from the Skimmer-Tank has an oil concentration below **200 ppm**. The treated water is then pumped for re-injection into a disposal well.
