# Lactic Acid Production from Whey Permeate

## Overview

This process converts lactose-rich whey permeate—a by-product of dairy processing—into lactic acid. The system is designed for both economic and environmental benefits, addressing waste valorization and reducing pollution from dairy by-products.

## Process Flow

### 1. **Feed Preparation and Storage**

- **Input**: Whey permeate (95% water, 4–5% lactose, trace minerals)
- **Storage**: Permeate is introduced into a buffer tank for homogenization and temporary storage before processing[2].

### 2. **Reaction Section (Section 100)**

- **Hydrolysis and Catalytic Conversion**
  - **Hydrolysis Reactor (CSTR)**: 
    - **Function**: Hydrolyzes lactose at pH 2.3 and high temperature (150°C) and pressure (5 MPa).
    - **Design**: 4.14 m³ continuous stirred tank reactor equipped with a stirring system and temperature control.
  - **Packed Bed Reactor (PBR)**: 
    - **Function**: Converts lactose hydrolysates to lactic acid at 180°C and 5.5 MPa.
    - **Design**: Catalytic packed bed reactor.
  - **pH Control**: HCl and NaOH are added to maintain optimal reaction conditions.
  - **Heat Exchange**: Heat exchangers (HX-01, HX-02) cool the lactic acid stream exiting the PBR.
  - **Safety Features**:
    - Spare feed pump (P-101b) for continuous feed.
    - High-pressure safety valves and alarms for pressure control.
    - By-pass lines for heat exchangers in case of overheating.
    - Level control on reactors to prevent overflow.
    - Electrically operated valves for better control of process parameters[1].

### 3. **Filtration Section (Section 200)**

- **Function**: Separates lactic acid from residual solids and other components.
- **Technology**: Reverse osmosis membranes and nanofiltration.
- **Challenges**: Prone to fouling and clogging, requiring periodic maintenance and monitoring[1].

### 4. **Purification Section (Section 300)**

- **Function**: Concentrates and purifies lactic acid to achieve 99% purity.
- **Technology**: Cascade of low-pressure evaporators.
  - **Vapor Management**: Generated vapor is condensed and fed upstream for heat integration.
  - **Sensitivity**: Sensitive to deviations in operating conditions, which can affect product quality and quantity.
- **Energy Input**: Provided by inter-stage compressors (C-301/2/3)[1].
