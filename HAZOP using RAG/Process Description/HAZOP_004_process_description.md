## Process Overview

The process is designed to treat **400 kt/year** of **whey permeate**, a liquid waste from the dairy industry. The whey first undergoes a reaction stage where lactose is hydrolyzed and converted to lactic acid. The product stream is then filtered to separate by-products, sugars, and minerals. Finally, the crude lactic acid is purified through evaporation to produce a **99% pure lactic acid** product.

## Key Process Units and Equipment

### Section 100: Reaction

This section is the core of the process where the chemical conversion occurs. It operates at high pressure and is sensitive to deviations in temperature and pH.

* **Continuous Stirred Tank Reactor (CSTR) (RX-101)**
    * **Purpose:** To hydrolyze lactose.
    * **Volume:** 4.14 m³.
    * **Operating Pressure:** 5 MPa.
    * **Operating Temperature:** 150°C.
    * **Operating pH:** 2.3 (controlled by HCl addition).

* **Packed Bed Reactor (PBR) (RX-102)**
    * **Purpose:** To catalytically convert lactose hydrolysates into lactic acid.
    * **Operating Pressure:** 5.5 MPa.
    * **Operating Temperature:** 180°C.
    * **pH Control:** NaOH is added after this stage.

* **Heat Exchangers (HX-101, HX-102, HX-103)**
    * **Purpose:** To pre-heat the whey permeate feed and cool the final lactic acid stream.

### Section 200: Filtration

This section uses pressure-driven membrane filtration to separate the desired product from by-products.

* **Reverse Osmosis (RO) and Nanofiltration (NF) Units**
    * **Purpose:** To separate the products, including by-products, sugars, and minerals.
    * **Operational Note:** This equipment is vulnerable to fouling and clogging.

### Section 300: Purification

This section concentrates the crude lactic acid to its final purity using a series of evaporators.

* **Low-Pressure Evaporator Cascade**
    * **Purpose:** To separate the crude lactic acid from water to achieve 99% purity.
    * **Operation:** The system is heat-integrated, with vapor generated from each stage used to heat the upstream evaporator. The only primary energy input is from inter-stage compressors (C-301/2/3).
