=== STORAGE TANK ANALYSIS: SW Storage ===

BASIC INFORMATION:
Tank Name: SW Storage
Tank Type: Storage Tank
Node ID: 1

TANK PROPERTIES:

ONTOLOGY CLASSIFICATION:
According to the storage tank ontology:
  The storage tank is a foundational component in a process plant, acting as a buffer to ensure continuous operation of interconnected units by decoupling their flow rates. This allows for asynchronous operations such as batch holding, mixing, or settling.

PROCESS FUNCTION:
This tank functions as a distribution vessel, supplying
multiple downstream process units.

INLET STREAMS:
  1. FROM: FCV-2 (Flow Control Valve)
     TO: SW Storage
     Connection Type: CONNECTED_TO
     Pipeline: Sw to storage pipe


OUTLET STREAMS:
  1. FROM: SW Storage
     TO: Stripper feed Pump (Pump)
     Connection Type: CONNECTED_TO
     Pipeline: SW from storage pipe

  2. FROM: SW Storage
     TO: TO-SKIM-RECYCLE (Sink)
     Connection Type: CONNECTED_TO
     Pipeline: HC oil skim 


SAFETY SYSTEMS:
  1. PRV-1 (Pressure Relief Valve on Sour water storage tank)
     Function: Provides overpressure protection


INSTRUMENTATION & CONTROL:
  1. FCV-2 (Flow Control Valve)
     Connection Type: CONNECTED_TO
     Function: Process monitoring and control related to SW Storage


CHEMICALS IN TANK (INFERRED FROM INLETS):

PROCESS INTEGRATION:
Upstream Integration: Receives material from:
  • SW Feed Pump
Downstream Integration: Supplies material to:
  • Stripper feed Pump

This storage tank serves as a critical buffer in the process,
enabling continuous operation and flow rate management.
