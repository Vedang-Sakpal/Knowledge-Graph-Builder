# Process Description: Sour Water Stripper Plant

## Overview
The sour water stripper plant processes a refinery sour water stream to remove contaminants before disposal or reuse.

## Process Flow

1.  **Feed Introduction**
   
    A refinery sour water stream, containing water, hydrocarbons (slop oil), and dissolved gases (such as ammonia and hydrogen sulfide), is fed into the system.

2.  **Surge Drum (`sw-surge-drum`)**
   
    The sour water enters a surge drum where **slop oil** is separated from the water phase due to density differences. The oil forms a layer on top (light phase) and is skimmed off, while the water (heavy phase) is drawn from the bottom.

3.  **Storage Tank (`sw-storage-tank`)**
    
    The separated sour water is pumped to a storage tank where any residual carried-over hydrocarbons can be further skimmed off. This ensures minimal oil content in the water sent to the stripper.

4.  **Heat Exchanger**
    
    The sour water is preheated in a heat exchanger before entering the stripper to improve stripping efficiency.

5.  **Steam Stripper (`sour-water-stripper`)**
    
    The preheated sour water is fed to a steam stripper where steam is introduced to strip out dissolved gases such as **ammonia (NH₃)** and **hydrogen sulfide (H₂S)**. These gases are volatile and are carried overhead with the steam.

6.  **Overhead System**
    
    The overhead vapor mixture (steam, H₂S, NH₃) is condensed in a **condenser**, and the non-condensables (H₂S, NH₃) are separated from the condensate in an **accumulator**. The condensate may be refluxed or sent for further treatment.

7.  **Treated Water Effluent**
    
    The stripped water (now free of most dissolved gases and hydrocarbons) is pumped out from the bottom of the stripper for further treatment or safe disposal.
