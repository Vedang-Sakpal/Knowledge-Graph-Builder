Hazard,Causes,Consequences,Likelihood and Prevention,Emergency and Mitigation,Action
No flow,"P-01 failure, Total blockage of HX-102 or HX-AP",Process stops,"Very unlikely Periodic pump maintenance, Monitor HX AP",Add a spare pump or bypass stream on HX-102,"Dynamic analysis of pump operation, add engineering upgrades"
Loss flow,Malfunctioning of pump P-01,"Lower residence time, Lower conversion, Lower LA production",Likely Periodic pump maintenance,"Add clean-up procedure, add HX-102 bypass","Model HX fouling risk & ensure maintenance, adjust set up"
More flow,Malfunctioning of pump P-01,"Higher residency time, Possible overflow","Unlikely Periodic pump maintenance, periodic product sampling","Emergency overflow tank, pump trip, level control",Retain & arrange periodic control on pump set up
Loss pressure,Malfunctioning of pump P-01,"Partial evaporation, reaction rate reduced",Likely Periodic pump maintenance,HX clean-up procedure,Design a pressure padding orifice on HX-102
More pressure,"Malfunctioning of pump P-01, Blocked hydrolysis reactor HX-102 or HX-AP","Damage to reactor or pump, Instrumentation malfunction (high pressure)","Unlikely Periodic pump maintenance, periodic product sampling","Pressure alarm, trip system, emergency vent",Design a pressure padding orifice on HX-102
Loss temperature,"Too low hot utility temp. in HX-102, dirty HX-102","Losses due to thermal inefficiency, reaction rate gets reduced",Likely Periodic monitoring of hot utility maintenance,"Undesired product, regular stream analysis","Model HX fouling risk & ensure maintenance, adjust set up"
More temperature,Too high hot utility temp. in HX-102,Possible equipment/material damage,Likely Control loop on hot utility,"Product recall, regular stream analysis","Temperature modelling & control, regular maintenance"
Loss pH,Too high HCl flow,"Possible degradation, reaction rate gets reduced",Unlikely Control loop on HCl flow,"Low pH alarm, regular pH monitoring","Model HX fouling risk & ensure maintenance, adjust set up"
More pH,Too low HCl flow,"Possible degradation, reaction rate gets reduced",Unlikely Control loop on HCl flow,No notable impact,Dynamic modelling on HCl control
No Mixing,Broken mixer,"Bad mixing, reaction rate gets reduced","Very unlikely; Periodic maintenance of mixer, periodic product sampling",Mixer replacement procedure,Study of acidity effect on mixer blades
