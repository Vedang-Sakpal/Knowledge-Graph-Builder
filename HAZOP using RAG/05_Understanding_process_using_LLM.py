    given chemical plant.

    Based on BOTH documents provided above, please perform the following analysis:

    1.  **Identify Main Material Streams**: Trace the primary flow paths from their source, through all major equipment, to their final sink. Describe what is happening at each stage.
    2.  **Describe Key Equipment and Purpose**: For each major piece of equipment, explain its role in the process, referencing both documents.
    3.  **Detail the Control and Energy Flows**: Explain how the process is controlled. Describe the key control loops, mentioning the sensor, the controller, and the final control element (like a valve or pump) it operates.
    4.  **Summarize Inputs and Outputs**: List the main chemical inputs to the entire process and all the final products or waste streams leaving the system.
