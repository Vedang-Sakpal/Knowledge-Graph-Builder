# Knowledge Graph (KG) Builder for HAZOP Reports

This directory contains the necessary files to construct a knowledge graph from existing HAZOP (Hazard and Operability) study reports. The primary goal is to transform tabular HAZOP data into a structured graph format, making it easier to query, analyze, and visualize the relationships between different components of a HAZOP study.

## üìÇ File Descriptions

* **`KG_Builder.ipynb`**: A Jupyter Notebook that contains the Python code for the entire KG construction process. It reads the raw data from the CSV file, processes it, and generates a Cypher script to build the knowledge graph in a Neo4j database.

* **`HAZOP_006.csv`**: This CSV file is the input data for the KG builder. It contains a sample HAZOP report in a structured, tabular format.

* **`hazop_knowledge_graph.cypher`**: This is a Cypher script generated by the `KG_Builder.ipynb` notebook. It contains the commands to create the nodes and relationships for the knowledge graph. This file can be directly imported into a Neo4j database to create the graph.
    * `hazop_knowledge_graph_corrected.cypher` and `hazop_knowledge_graph_new.cypher` are different versions or iterations of the generated Cypher script, reflecting refinements in the graph model.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Use

1.  **Prerequisites**:
    * Python 3.x installed.
    * Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab installed.
    * A running instance of Neo4j Desktop or Neo4j Server.

2.  **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:
    * Open and run the `KG_Builder.ipynb` notebook. This will execute the code to process the `HAZOP_006.csv` file.

3.  **Generate the Cypher Script**:
    * Upon successful execution, the notebook will generate a `.cypher` file (e.g., `hazop_knowledge_graph.cypher`). This file contains the commands to create the knowledge graph.

4.  **Import into Neo4j**:
    * Open the Neo4j Browser.
    * You can either copy and paste the content of the generated `.cypher` file into the Neo4j Browser and run the commands, or you can use the `neo4j-admin` command-line tool to import the script.

## üìä Expected Output

The successful execution of this process will result in a knowledge graph within your Neo4j database. This graph will represent the entities from the HAZOP report (such as causes, consequences, and safeguards) as nodes, and the relationships between them as edges. This structured data can then be used for advanced querying and analysis of the HAZOP study.
