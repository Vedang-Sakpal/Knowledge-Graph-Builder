=== STORAGE TANK ANALYSIS: SW Storage ===

BASIC INFORMATION:
Tank Name: SW Storage
Tank Type: Storage Tank
Node ID: 45

TANK PROPERTIES:

ONTOLOGY CLASSIFICATION:
According to the storage tank ontology:
  Storage tanks serve as buffer vessels in process plants, enabling continuous operation by decoupling flow rates between process units.

PROCESS FUNCTION:
This tank functions as a distribution vessel, supplying
multiple downstream process units.

INLET STREAMS:
  1. FROM: SW Feed Pump
     TO: SW Storage
     Connection Type: CONNECTED_TO
     Pipeline: Sw to storage pipe


OUTLET STREAMS:
  1. FROM: SW Storage
     TO: Stripper feed Pump
     Connection Type: CONNECTED_TO
     Pipeline: SW from storage pipe

  2. FROM: SW Storage
     TO: TO-SKIM-RECYCLE
     Connection Type: CONNECTED_TO
     Pipeline: HC oil skim 


SAFETY SYSTEMS:
  1. PRV-1 (Pressure Relief Valve)
     Function: Provides overpressure protection


INSTRUMENTATION & CONTROL:
This tank is equipped with the following instruments for monitoring and control:
  • FCV-2 (Flow Control Valve)


CHEMICALS IN TANK (INFERRED FROM INLETS):
  • Sour water

UPSTREAM PROCESS FLOW AND CHEMICALS:
  • Chemical 'Sour water' originates from:
    PATH: REFINERY Unit -[SW from refinery pipe]-> Surge Drum-1 -[SW out pipe]-> SW Feed Pump -[SW feed pipe-1]-> NRV-4 -[SW feed pipe-2]-> FCV-2 -[Sw to storage pipe]-> SW Storage

DOWNSTREAM PROCESS FLOW AND CHEMICALS:
  • Contents are sent to sink 'ACID-GAS-TO-S-PLANT-EX' which contains 'Ammonia vapour':

  • Contents are sent to sink 'TO-ATM' which contains 'None':
    PATH: SW Storage -[vent pipe 2]-> PRV-1 -[vent to atm]-> TO-ATM

PROCESS INTEGRATION:
Upstream Integration: Receives material from:
  • SW Feed Pump
Downstream Integration: Supplies material to:
  • Stripper feed Pump
  • TO-SKIM-RECYCLE

This storage tank serves as a critical buffer in the process,
enabling continuous operation and flow rate management.
